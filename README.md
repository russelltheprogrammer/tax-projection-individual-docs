## Disclosure: :rotating_light:

Although I do believe this tax projection to be accurate and I have tested it for bugs do not rely upon this to estimate your own taxes. Taxes are complicated and this projection does not include all tax scenarios. Please consult a tax professional while using this application.

## More Features? :bulb:

In the future, I plan to make a more advanced version of the application. However, I build this application all by myself and I have limited time capacity. There are a lot of additional features I would have liked to add to make this application more accurate and more functional, including adding additional scenarios, more jurisdications, and the list goes on...

If you have a specific feature requests? Please let me know.

## About :mega:

I developed this application entirely from scratch, encompassing the entire process from idea generation to conceptualization and designing the user interface. Throughout the development, I relied solely on my own skills and expertise, without resorting to tutorials, templates, or boilerplate code.

This application was created based on how a tax accountant and a programmer think, trying to create the best user experience from the knowledge of both. It is worth noting that this application is not something a tax accountant or a programmer could construct by themself. It necessitates a deep understanding of both disciplines to bring it to fruition.

The creation of this project was driven by my desire to enhance my programming abilities and to derive personal satisfaction from merging my interests in programming and tax accounting. As I continue to expand and add more features, the complexity of the project grows, requiring meticulous attention. To simplify the application, I employed Redux to streamline the management of global state. However, the intricate nature of the tax codes in the United States and various States introduces additional challenges. Nevertheless, I am enthusiastic about the development of this application and embrace any obstacles that come my way.

The primary purpose of this application is to assist individuals and accountants in estimating quarterly taxes for themself or their clients. Given the complexity of the United States and State tax codes, not everyone can afford the services of a high-end tax accountant. Hence, my aim is to make this application accessible to freelancers, CPAs, EAs, accountants, and others.

In developing this application, I had to make choices regarding the level of complexity to incorporate. Constructing a comprehensive tax projection application, accounting for every intricate detail, is an arduous and time-consuming task. The intricate nature of the United States and State tax codes further exacerbates this challenge. Hence, I had to strike a balance between the time investment and the complexity involved in building the application. It seems to resemble a problem of Big O Notation (a little coding joke) in terms of optimizing efficiency...
